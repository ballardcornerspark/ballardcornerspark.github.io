			<div class="entrytext">
				<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">This page documents the history of the Ballard Corners Park.  The most recent event appears first.  For additional history, see the links at the <a href="#Prior%20Events">bottom of the page</a>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><u><strong><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Community Meeting &#8211; 18 Oct 06</font></strong></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We had a productive meeting last night.  In attendance were myself, Rebecca Carr (our co-chair), Gabriella Moller, Susan Oâ€™Neill, Jody and Mark Stewart, and Gordon Waddell.  Garry Owens (our Department of Neighborhoods project manager) also came and offered us many good suggestions.   </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Gabriella got a much deserved thank you for her and Phoebeâ€™s hard work on the interim planting.  If you havenâ€™t seen it, come by the park to see it.  I think it makes a wonderful addition to the park.  Iâ€™ve always thought our park is on the small side, but after breaking my back last Sunday to fix up a very small part of it, I now see it as a much larger park and a much larger project.    </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We discussed the brochure.  I got some helpful feedback on the design.  Look for a new and improved version soon.  We discussed and agreed to mail the brochure to a geographic area bounded by   NW 58<sup>th</sup> St.    and   75<sup>th</sup> St.  , and   15<sup>th</sup> Ave NW    to   24<sup>th</sup> Ave NW  .  The cost will be approximately $1000.  We discussed that this was really mostly an outreach effort and not strictly a fundraising idea.   Rebecca suggested that we postpone the mailing to early next year to avoid being lost in the holiday mail crush.  Garry told us about the success a past Volunteer Park project had in going door-to-door fundraising; if I remember correctly, they set a goal of 10,000 in fundraising door-to-door, but ended up with more than $100,000!!!   </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We thought that weâ€™d mail the brochure in early 2007, and then go fundraising and building community door-to-door in the spring.  Garry had some good ideas about how to appear.  We should be wearing T-shirts and buttons, bring children (when possible) and go when people might be outside (i.e. a sunny and/or warm weekend day or weekday evening).  He also said that the   Volunteer    Park   group made â€œbadgesâ€ from their brochures and wore them around their necks.  We agreed that this sounded good and will plan to follow-up on the mailing later in the spring.  Other ideas bubbled up â€“ yard signs to show support, selling T-shirts, selling buttons â€“ in addition to asking for direct cash contributions.    </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Gordon reported on his research on getting T-shirts.  A local vender on    Ballard Ave   (Elephant Gerald?) looked like the best bet.  Everyone was supportive of getting roughly 100 T-shirts (in various sizes) to start.  The cost will be $6.50 to $10.00 per shirt, depending on the complexity of the design, number of colors, number of sides, etc.  It was agreed that spending the $650-1000 to make and initial run of 100 T-shirts was appropriate.  Gordon and I are the T-shirt subcommittee.  We will offer the T-shirts initially to our many fine volunteers first, then spread beyond that as deemed appropriate.  We may try to solicit donations of approximately $10 to help cover costs.  But the T-shirts are good PR for us.  Gordon and I will try to have the shirts done ASAP.    </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">I presented the idea of buttons.  We can make buttons for roughly $1 a piece.  We agreed to run 200 initially.  I designed buttons and sent them to a printer (Express Printing in Ballard) and delivered them to Acme Rubber Stamp on   Ballard Ave   for completion today.  Weâ€™ll have them by early next week.     </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We were discussing the T-shirts and the need for a slogan.  Gordon suggested â€œBringing Green to Ballardâ€.  Jody then suggested â€œI park it at Ballard Corners.â€  Everyone (except yours truly, who was very tired and hungry and humor impaired) laughed heartily and loved it.  After some processing, I got the joke.  We agreed that we would adopt it as our new slogan.  Look for it on the T-shirts and buttons.    </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Gordon also presented the idea of making placard for local businesses to put in their shops.  It might read â€œElephant Gerald supports   Ballard   Corners   Park   â€ and have our logo or something similar.  I broached the subject with the employee at Express Printing and he said the owner would probably be supportive.  I think Iâ€™ll also try to talk Acme Rubber Stamp into keeping one or more of our buttons on display in their case.    </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Gordon presented the idea of being an â€œaffiliateâ€ with Amazon.com (his former employer).  The concept is that we put a link to Amazon on our website and ask people who would nominally shop at Amazon.com during the holiday season (such and Gordon and I) to go via our website and click through to Amazon (or other retailers).  As a return to us, Amazon will give us approximately 4% of the purchase price.  This could be a great way to get people to contribute just by shopping online as they normally would.  Again, Gordon and I formed a subcommittee to get this up and running ASAP, before the holiday season.  Weâ€™ll also try to find other on-line merchants that offer similar deals.  If any of you know of any, email or call me.    </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Susan and I will meet with the extremely powerful Washington State Representative Helen Sommers next Thursday, 26 Oct.  She is the chair of the House Appropriations Committee (they decide how money is spent).  Weâ€™ll present the park concept to her and ask her for financial support in the next legislative session.  If anyone has advice about how to approach this meeting, please let me know.  After that, Iâ€™ll set up meetings with our other state legislators, King County Councilmember Larry Phillips, and possibly King County Executive Ron Sims.   </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We briefly discussed how to spend the $15,000 Small and Simple grant from the Department of Neighborhoods.  I suggested the following budget: $12,000 to Barker for design development, which will get us to 50% of construction documents.  $1000 would go to mailing brochures, $650 to 1000 would go to T-shirts, $200 to buttons, $100+ to the interim planting, and the remainder to be decided later (probably outreach or fundraising).  We hope that contributions will fill in other needs until we can get money from the DON Large Project Fund or other sources.</font></p>
<p align="left"><u><strong><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Interim Planting &#8211; 15 Oct 06</font></strong></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We had a very wet planting party.  Thanks to everyone who helped â€“  Phoebe Fine , Gabriella Moller, Henry Burton, Danika Waddell, Brent Bottles, and Susan Wersberg.  If you havenâ€™t seen the fruit of our work, swing by.  We filled in the fence post holes, created a small garden by the sign, and planted bulbs next to Mackenzie and Brockâ€™s garage.  We saved digging up the large boxwood for another day.  Just as we finished at 12:30, the sky turned blue and the rain stopped.    </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">As Gabriella pointed out, we seem to have a knack for picking rainy days for park events.  The fence knock down party and the garage sale were also rained on. </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><u><strong><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Community Meeting &#8211; 20 Sep 06</font></strong></u></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We had a productive meeting with approximately a dozen neighbors.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We discussed meeting regularly. We agreed that meeting once per month at the Ballard Boys &#038; Girls club on the third Wednesday at 7 seemed good. See you on 18 Oct at 7.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We discussed the new Small and Simple grant from the Department of Neighborhoods for $15,000. Previously, we were stymied by the inability to do further design by the lack of a topographical survey. We couldnâ€™t do the survey because the city doesnâ€™t own the South lot. We discussed work-arounds. We could employ Barker to further develop the design of the rain gardens, which are in the right of way (and thus can be surveyed topographically). Another thought was expressed that Parks could ask the landowner if we could step onto his property long enough to do a survey, thus allowing Barker to further the design on the whole park and refine the cost estimate.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We discussed development of a brochure for fundraising and community development purposes. Sam brought some great examples. Iâ€™ll work on a mock-up.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We discussed getting T-shirts made. Gordon is going to look into hitting up Ballard Sip and Ship and the other T-shirt shop on Ballard Ave for a discount for sponsorship.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">We discussed (and decided on) a fall planting event. Save Sunday, 15 Oct at 10 AM on your calendar. Weâ€™ll plant bulbs for the spring and other fine things to spruce things up in the interim as park construction probably wonâ€™t begin until 2008. Davidya pointed out that the two roundish shrubs donâ€™t enhance the space (primarily due to location) and we should remove them. Apparently the blackberries are rearing their ugly heads, despite cardboard and wood chips. Weâ€™ll attack them again. Iâ€™ll consult with Phoebe and Gabriella about a plan.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Iâ€™ll check with the Market St. Starbucks to see if theyâ€™ll help us out on that date. They have a community volunteer program that may help us with both volunteers and money. Haley will send me the info.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Thatâ€™s most of what we discussed. Watch your inbox and the website for moreâ€¦</font></p>
<p><u><strong><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Simultaneous Parks Department Events &#8211; Tuesday 12 Sep 06</font></strong></u></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Rebecca attended the award ceremony for our new $15,000 Department of Neighborhoods &#8220;Small and Simple&#8221; grant at the    Youngstown   Cultural   Arts   Center  .  (Kudos to Rebecca for working hard on the application.)  Meanwhile I went to the &#8220;Friends of&#8230;[your favorite park]&#8221; event at the </font><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Westbridge Maintenance and Operations center.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66"><strong><u>Night Out &#8211; Tuesday 1 Aug 06</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">As has happened the last two years, neighbors (special thanks goes to Rebecca Carr, Erin Eason, and Daria Rutledge) have organized a special night in the park.  The theme is to get to know your neighbors to prevent crime.  Hamburgers and potluck fed the attendees.  The Seattle Fire Department brought their Ballard Ladder truck.  Neighbors got to see the design and talk about the park.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66"><strong><u>Garage Sale &#8211; Sunday 30 Aug 06</u></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Our garage sale was a success! We raised $313.91, nearly 0.08% of the construction budget ($430,000). We only have to hold 1322 more garages sales to fund the development of the park.</font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">OK, it wasnâ€™t a great fundraiser, but we did raise awareness for the park and meet some neighbors, which was really the goal, as it is for tomorrowâ€™s Night Out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Special thanks go to Gabriella Moeller for coming up with the idea and organizing the event.  Brent Bottles and Alta helped immensely during the sale, as did others.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Pam Kliment (our project manager at Seattle Parks) took this wonderful &#8220;arty&#8221; picture.  She says it was made with a &#8220;Holga&#8221; &#8211; a double exposure.   She and her husband came by to donate items and pick up a few necessary kitchen goods.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype" color="#796b66">Several members of the steering committee had a chance to review the <a target="_blank" href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/images/second%20community%20meeting/1763PreferredPlan.pdf">preferred alternative design</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/images/second%20community%20meeting/1763Obliquebw.pdf">also here in an bird&#8217;s eye view</a>) based on the feedback from the second community meeting.  It included the two features most admired &#8211; the curved sidewalk and the &#8220;rain garden&#8221; &#8211; an opportunity to collect runoff and direct it into the soil.</font></p>
