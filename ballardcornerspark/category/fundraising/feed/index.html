				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we were done paying all our bills, we had a few thousand dollars left over.  Two other non-profits helped us and we wanted to thank them.  We gave $400 to <a title="Ballard B &amp; G Club" href="http://www.ballard.positiveplace.org/" target="_blank">Ballard Boys &amp; Girls Club</a> for letting us meet in their building and another $400 to the <a title="Ballard Historical Society" href="http://www.ballardhistory.org/" target="_blank">Ballard Historical Society</a> for providing the cool historical photos in the corner store and helping edit the interpretive panels.</p>
<p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club sent us this letter in return.</p>

<p>It is a bit odd.  We are an organization with no financial assets.  The Friends of Ballard Corners has no bank account, no officers (on paper), no board, no nothing.  We rely on Groundswell NW to handle all our money as our &#8220;fiscal sponsor&#8221;.  Any money we receive goes straight to them.  Any money we &#8220;spend&#8221; comes straight from them.  In return, they receive a 5% cut of all our donations &#8211; this helps them fund their operations.</p>
<p>It seems strange to me that we would give money from our account at a non-profit to another non-profit.  No one gets a write-off.  But, nonetheless, we were inclined to want to thank two organizations &#8211; <a title="Ballard Boys &amp; Girls Club" href="http://www.ballard.positiveplace.org/" target="_blank">Ballard Boys &amp; Girls Club</a> and <a title="Ballard Historical Society" href="http://www.ballardhistory.org/" target="_blank">Ballard Historical Society</a> for their help.</p>
<p>The Ballard Boys &amp; Girls Club hosted virtually all of our meetings, including the large public meetings.  The Ballard Historical Society helped with our historical photos and writing up the verbiage of the panels.  In return, we wanted to support them.  We did it with profuse thanks and a check for $400 each.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sitting here doing some totals and cutting a check and thought I&#8217;d give everyone an update on our referral fees from Amazon.com.</p>
<p>You may recall that if you use the links to the left of this page, or our <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/shop">ballardcornerspark.org/shop</a> links, or this <a href="http://amazon.com/?tag=ballardcorner-20">amazon.com/?tag=ballardcorner-20</a> link, we receive a percentage (4-10%) on items purchased (the 10% is for mp3&#8217;s).</p>
<p>So far this year, our industrious shoppers have defied the recession and raised about $200 in referral fees from 76 items and almost $4000.</p>
