<p>We had an extremely large turnout, the full stack of US governance from community to city to state to the Senator, and there were many thanks all round.</p>
<p>Thanks to the supporters on the day, with a special thanks from my belly to <a href="http://www.veracipizza.com/">Veraci Pizza</a> who served free pizza for an hour and a half to a very happy line of pizza-lovers.</p>
<p>More pictures will be posted forthwith, but for now feel free to read the timely report on <a href="http://www.myballard.com/2009/10/10/ballards-newest-park-officially-opens/">myballard</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the good fortune of hearing from a former neighbor &#8211; Shirley (Francis) Faris.  Here is what she remembers about Bill Boutin&#8217;s store:  &#8220;We lived at 1742 [62nd] and my mother would send me to buy bread or milk.  The store had a central door with big windows on either side. The floor was wooden  planks. From the door straight back was a long  wooden counter where the cash  register was located along with many jars and containers with candy. The candy  was probably a penny to a nickle. The chocolate bon bons were usually with  vanilla filling but if you got a pink filling you got a free one.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that it is wonderful to hear from people who recall the history of the place.</p>
