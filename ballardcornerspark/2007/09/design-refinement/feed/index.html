		<description><![CDATA[From Keith Ellis -

I suppose this would also be a good time to ask about physical separation between the park and the two adjacent lots (ie: will there be a fence or hedge dense enough to insure the privacy/safety of the
neighboring yards)?  It appears from the plan that the hedge will be removed which will leave our yard quite exposed, and the replacement does not appear dense enough to prevent passage.

best regards -

		<description><![CDATA[From Andrea Faste -

  I do love the entry portal with the counter features.  I&#039;m not so crazy about the living room furniture in cement.  Agree with David B. that they could be graffitti targets, but more than that, we are trying to get kids to
engage with nature, not simulate being in a living room indoors, so I prefer the pictures as I saw them in Design F, which looked just more like outdoor play areas.  I&#039;d consider perhaps a clump of bamboo (well barriered so it won&#039;t spread...or even a 10 x 10 area allowed to grow to tall grass, so kids have the option of knowing what it is like to get lost in tall grass.  Overall, however, this is YOUR neighborhood, so you need to do what you think your kids would like.  I think you have done a masterful job of managing this project, and however it turns out, it will be great.

		<description><![CDATA[From Sam Star -

David,

Thanks for the opportunity to comment on the design.  I really like it.  I have a major concern about graffiti.  Many of the surfaces shown (entryway, living room furniture, house foundation walls, and the counter) look like prime targets for graffiti tags.  Maybe the project can include tiles, mosaics and/or texturing of the smooth surfaces?

The store counter could create hiding spaces.  Maybe the counter can have an open design.

		<description><![CDATA[From Stephen Lundgren -

The trees at eastern street edge look to be visually transparent from the street, for safety views of park activity, but the SW corner esp looks that it might be a hiding place esp after the foliage matures. Tom Whittemore and I had the same concerns with the ground cover when we were touring the new Ballard Commons, up in the NW corner, and I have them here even more so with such a secluded park.
If I have more thoughts will let you know, please post these as coming from me at
s.lundgren@comcast.net

Thanks Stephen]]></description>
