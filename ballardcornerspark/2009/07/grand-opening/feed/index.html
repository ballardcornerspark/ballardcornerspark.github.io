		<description><![CDATA[I know they&#039;re incredibly busy, especially in the summer, but I wonder if Veraci pizza would be interested in bringing their wood fired oven to the park and making pizzas for the celebration.  If people are interested in this I will contact them (I know the owners and they have been very supportive of the park).  I would offer to pay them, so I would need to know what budget we have for this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We live pretty close to the park, and my fiance could take pictures for the event.  We also have a projector, laptop, and portable projection screen at home, we could show a movie or two...

We have a mad amount of movies at our house, so name a genre or some movies and we could probably come up with them.

We also have several grills in our apt. complex we could roll down to the park if there&#039;s interest.  We&#039;re gone the weekends of August 22nd and 29th, but we could leave some of this stuff with someone if needed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if there is any way we could have a Grand Opening or Night Out theme that represents the era of the Corner store. 40s boogie woogie or 50s rock and roll music. Even 40s and 50s garb. 40&#039;s was war time - USO, Rosie and the We Can Do It them and such. 50&#039;s with the poodle skirts, slicked back hair for guys, etc.

We might even be able to do movies if anyone has the projection equipment.]]></description>
