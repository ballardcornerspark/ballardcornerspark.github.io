		<description><![CDATA[ab -

I appreciate the feedback and Iâ€™#39;m glad you took the time to make the comment.

I think it might be helpful to understand the parkâ€™#39;s history.  The site was first identified by Groundswell NW as a possible park.  It was then included on the Pro-Parks Levy list.

I first became involved in 2006.  We held a series of three design meetings in which residents had ample time to comment and steer the design.  It was the community that wanted all the elements of the park.

We, as the steering committee, are trying to implement the communityâ€™#39;s will.  That said, you are not the only person who thinks the park is over designed.  We will keep your comments in mind as we proceed.

The last element of the park that we are wrestling with is the â€œcorner storeâ€.  We donâ€™#39;t have the money to implement it as designed; therefore we are looking at alternatives.  There is a mock up at the park right now which shows the massing of some of the elements that we are thinking about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi - I live near the new park and I am very excited and thankful to have a park going in.  I don&#039;t mean to be a buzz kill, but it&#039;s beginning to seem like the current plan is a bit overkill and spending money for the sake of spending money.  The landscaping is nice, but now we have a curvy sidewalk, an archway?, concrete furniture, etc.  Once again, the park is great, but I think we need to know when to say &#039;when&#039;.

Thanks.]]></description>
