		<description><![CDATA[OK - After reading everyone&#039;s comments I think that while it is nice to get everyone&#039;s comments - the committee should follow the vision that they worked so hard on...the corner store.

For what it is worth...with smaller columns - closer to the road.

Also, after reading the &quot;Grandma of 2&quot; comments - some small benches would be a nice thing as well.

Most importantly, the time &#038; energy the planning committee has done on this should be honored by following the vision that came from hours and hours of work &#038; meetings they put into this.

While it is nice to be asked about this - thank you - I feel that most of these decisions were made already and we should respect what the committee decided upon (or we should have gone to the meetings).

Thanks for asking - I love the park &#038; am very happy to have something so nice to my home.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are so many great thoughts and positive reactions out there, that I think this is wonderful and also very difficult.  People are emotionally attached to their ideas.  The clear majority are interested in a historical reference, and many of those really like the corner store.  As I did before the design got a bit complicated stylisticly and beyond our budget.  I also think the scale issue is valid.  No easy way out.

I expressed my design opinion last time we met.  Some kind of lighter structure that has ceramic faced panels built in to capture the history, and can be a living design element.  Less concrete, no concrete walks - perhaps using the cinder path/edging.  I do think there needs to be something at the corner.  I don&#039;t want to do another design though, unless it is with the steering committee using Morgan&#039;s talents to facilitate a shared concept.

Not much help ehh?  Sorry.  Design seldom can satisfy everyone.  The good point is that we have 90% done to wide acclaim.

And to the wonderful grandmum who lamented nothing for her 2 yr. old to do.  I&#039;d suggest she keep coming back, that active play structures are far from the only way to enjoy the park.  Lead her grandaughter over to the apple tree south of the play structure to hang from the limb, walk the short wall, roll in the grass, and ask grandmum to read her a story curled up on a blanket under the twisting pear tree.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I&#039;d never seen the corner store option before I&#039;d really like Morgan&#039;s design because of the flow and the adding of additional seating.  It&#039;s a nice idea and well thought out but I guess because I&#039;ve already had the corner store in mind I still like that one best.

I like the store concept because it adds a table element to the park, which seems like a great addition now that the park is finished.  With reflections from our usage so far, I&#039;d definitely like the addition of the stools and tables because right now my son&#039;s favorite thing is to play at the bike rack.  He&#039;s too little for the play structure, walking along the cement wall gets boring quickly, but the bike rack has the different stalls he can walk around and hold onto.  He&#039;d be able to do the same thing at the stools and I could sit!  I realize someday (someday!!) he&#039;ll actually be walking and that won&#039;t matter as much but I&#039;m thinking for the little guys the tables/stools would add an additional play area, as well as adding it for the older set as a pretend play area.  Also when my son and I have gone we&#039;ve laid out a blanket but that wouldn&#039;t be quite as convenient for eating.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the park looks great so far lots of green space. I agree with you David, that the corner store concept is a tribute to the historical aspect of the park. I think the pictures &#038; tiles should be worked into that part. It was a small store not a soda fountain, maybe something of weathered wood with a place undercover for the photos &#038; tiles. It doesn&#039;t have to be large, a couple of columns &#038; a roof. I don&#039;t think that the history part should be forgotten, some of us are old enough to remember.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of the choices given I like the corner store entrance.  I would prefer that there wasnâ€™#39;t any art in the parks, at least small ones with limited space such as Ballard Corners.  To me the most beautiful art there could possibly be are nature&#039;s own trees, bushes, annuals and perennials.  I want a passive park experience, not an active one.  However, given that in Seattle, it seems that any new park HAS to have art (and a children&#039;s play area), I like the corner store.

I want the seating areas underneath the shade of deciduous trees.  I can&#039;t take the sun anymore and won&#039;t use any areas not shaded (which is why I have little or no use for the Ballard Commons except in winter--a pity indeed).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I prefer the seat-wall to the corner store, because it would provide useful seating and edge definition without creating a kids-forehead level impediment to rambunctious play in the northern grassy aree, and because it nicely echoes the low wall around the play structure.

Rather than dispensing with the corner store columns, however, I suggest moving them to flank the path at the northwest entrance, where they can house the donor tiles etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;m leaning towards the seatwall.  I fear the stools would have additional maintenance needs due to normal use as well as that of vandalism.  The simpler design of the seat wall seems less fraught with potential problems.  Additionally, I like the look of the seatwall.  Ideally I&#039;d like the seatwall with the columns but not the stools.

In terms of where to put the donor tiles, that&#039;s more difficult.  Could they be embedded in the top of the seatwall?  What about along the sides of the seatwall?  What about on the ground just inside of the seat wall as depicted in the in the attached picture?  (the attached picture contains a couple possible locations)

Those are my 2 cents.

[David&#039;s notes:  The tiles, in their current design, are too slippery for a walking surface.  It&#039;s possible they could be modified; I&#039;m unsure of the ramifications of doing that.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand the &quot;extra seating&quot; argument. Can&#039;t the half-walls that are used around playground, and along the back sidewalk be used as sitting areas? I mean, unless people are talking about seating with backs on them.

And how can you complain about the couch and chair being uncomfortable? You do realize those aren&#039;t actual pieces of leather furniture, don&#039;t you?

I also am kind of in agreement that the park looks complete the way it is. I saw a few kids playing soccer out there earlier today, and the way they were playing, a corner store or extended wall would have hampered their fun.]]></description>
