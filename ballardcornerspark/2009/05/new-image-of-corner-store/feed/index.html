		<description><![CDATA[I actually prefer the seating wall option because it would be more compatible with rambunctious play in that area of the park, but have no strong objection to the corner store design.  I do agree that it should be moved as far out towards the sidewalk as possible, to preserve the already well-utilized play area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I prefer the corner store option, but agree with John above that this one goes too deeply into the lawn.  I like the checkered floor, and would like to push it out so it runs maybe one square deep along the sidewalk and under the stools on either side, while ending right under the door posts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh no... To me, that&#039;s taking up WAYYYY to much grass/space/play area. Far too big. There&#039;s no where left for kids to run around and play, kick soccer balls, do cartwheels, throw the football... All things I&#039;ve seen happening in that area of grass since the park opened.

Maybe if the counter / columns were closer to the sidewalk? I like the corner store idea still, itâ€™s just really awkward in that position.]]></description>
