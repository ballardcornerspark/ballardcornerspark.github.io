		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Morgan.  Great idea.
My wife and I just moved in a block away from the park.  We have been eagerly awaiting its opening.  I have been following the blog.  I was delighted to see Morgan&#039;s response to the multiple choice question.  I wanted to weigh in but I too was overwhelmed by the many design elements.  Morgan&#039;s seatwall is elegant and beautiful.  It&#039;s the sort of thing that would fit within this residential neighborhood for decades to come.  I hope that there is enough funding to go ahead with an idea like this.  Thanks to Morgan for the cohesive, well thought out addition to the park plans.  Charlie]]></description>
