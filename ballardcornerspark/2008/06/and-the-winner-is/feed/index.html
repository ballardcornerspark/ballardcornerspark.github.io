I&#039;m agree with your thoughts.  I&#039;d like to be able to consider all sorts of variables, but I understand that the city is bound by law to accept the low bidder, except in cases where they are extremely unsuitable.

I have never understood why the absolute lowest bid gets the job even if it&#039;s not the best qualified company.

In my career, I&#039;ve seen vendors bid low, be accepted, and then have to be replaced, ultimately costing more than if a bit more due diligence was done and money spent up front.]]></description>
